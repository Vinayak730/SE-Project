# SE_Project - Learning encryption algos

This is a UI-based application for users to learn various encryption algorithms built on Python and Tkinter(UI library of python) using visual Studio-Code.

User Stories - 
  - User should be able to encrypt their message using an algorithm of their choice among the options available
  - User should be able to see encryption for some existing message as an example
  - User should be able to decrypt a message using the corresponding decryption method or some other method 
  - There should be algorithms which make use of “keys” for user authentication purpose
  - User should be able to see example of decryption for an existing text as sample
  - User should be able to see the algorithms at work i.e the step-by-step procedure/solution  of the algorithm while encryption/decryption taking place.
